//What is the difference between var and let? Var allows you declare and access variables within a global scope. Var also allows you to declarae a variable multiple
// times. Let allows you to declare a variable once within a given code block 
//What is the difference between var and const? Var allows you to declare and change variables even after runtime. Const only allows you to declare a variable once and doesn't allow you to change or 
// update it during runtime. This scope of variables declared using const is restricted to the block of code they are declared in.
//What is the difference between let and const? A variable declared using let can be altered and updated but never declared a second time within the same code block.
// When dealing with a variable declared using const you can't declare, the variable again nor can you change or update the variable during runtime. Both have a block
// scope.
//What is hoisting? When using the var keyword to declare a variable, the variable declaration is read first as if hoisted to the top of the code allowing a variable
// declared using var to be recognized even if it hasn't actually been created in code yet.
